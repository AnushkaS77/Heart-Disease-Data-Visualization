# Heart-Disease-Data-Visualization
# ❤️ Heart Disease Data Visualization

This project focuses on visualizing the Heart Disease dataset using Python libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. It provides visual insights into health factors influencing heart conditions such as age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, and more.

## 📊 Objectives
- Explore patterns in the heart disease dataset using 2D and multivariate visualizations.
- Identify trends and possible indicators of cardiovascular risk.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source:** Heart Disease UCI dataset
- **Features:** Age, Sex, Chest Pain, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Max Heart Rate, etc.

## 📈 Visualizations Included
- Histogram and KDE plots of numeric features
- Heatmap of correlations
- Boxplots to show distribution of risk factors across diagnosis groups
- Pairplots to explore feature interactions

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 💡 Key Insights
- Visual correlation of cholesterol and chest pain types with heart disease presence
- Impact of age and resting blood pressure on diagnosis trends

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
jupyter notebook B_4_Heart.ipynb
